<h1>Jason Wright</h1>

<p>I'm an electrical and computer engineer who's into designing, building, and hacking stuff. I'm interested in optics (in particular, cameras, computational photography, and the human visual system), discrete mathematics, quantum computing, transportation networks, cartography, modern art, politics, music, the New York Jets, and a continuously expanding set of other topics.</p>
