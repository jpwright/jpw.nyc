<p>Debcite is a search engine that provides the full text of articles based on search queries in the form of citations. It's designed primarily for use by intercollegiate debate teams, which frequently share citations for evidence they have quoted in the past on a <a href="http://68.233.253.124/xwiki/wiki/opencaselist/view/Cornell/WebHome">public wiki</a>. Debcite saves massive amounts of time by automatically locating the source of these citations when freely available online.</p>

<p>I created Debcite in my spare time while working as a software development intern at Assured Systems, Inc. Debcite is written in PHP and JavaScript. </p>
