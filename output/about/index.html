<h2>In more detail</h3>
<p>
I was born and raised in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peekskill,_New_York">Peekskill, NY</a>, although I also lived in the nearby hamlets of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortlandt_Manor,_New_York">Cortlandt Manor</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorktown_Heights,_New_York">Yorktown Heights</a>. After a childhood mostly filled with discovering the forest outside my house, injuring myself in creative ways, and Game Boy Color, I found my first true love in high school: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_debate">policy debate</a>. I spent many weekends traveling to tournaments across the Northeast, learning to research, think, argue, and speak. I spent summers at the University of Michigan and at the University of Kentucky training and practicing with other students from across the country. After a senior campaign that culminated in a New York state championship and a top 10 finish in the national Baker Award standings, I went off to college.
</p>

<p>
At Cornell University I decided to study engineering, and quickly found a passion for tinkering with electronics and computers. I built my first circuit in a freshman optics class: a 555 timer circuit to control pulse generation for a Nd:YAG laser. I wrote my first (serious) programs: image processing scripts in MATLAB for a robotics class. I played clarinet in Cornell's wind ensemble, I didn't make the cut for the ultimate frisbee team, I helped out on some robotics projects in the information science department. I kept the debating up, too: at the end of my senior year, I was a two-time qualifier for the National Debate Tournament, and had a "sweet 16" finish in the CEDA National Championship. I was honored to receive the Venephe A. Wilson award from the <a href="http://forensics.cornell.edu/">Cornell Forensics Society</a> for service to the program.
</p>

<p>
I stayed at Cornell for my Master's degree in electrical and computer engineering, where I had the opportunity to specialize more and gain more practical experience. I started to develop a focus in optoelectronics: my Master's thesis involved designing and building a light field camera, and I took classes in fiber optics, waveguides, optical computing, and nonlinear optics.
</p>

<p>
I spent my summers working at various technology-related internships, but none stood out as much as my summer with <a href="http://hackny.org">hackNY</a>, a non-profit organization that pairs technical students with startups in NYC. Beyond an awesome internship with <a href="http://nextjump.com">Next Jump</a> and a dorm at NYU, I had an amazing class of fellows from across the U.S. and Canada and had the privilege of meeting some really inspirational people from the NY tech scene.
</p>

<p>
This year I'm moving to Santa Cruz, CA to begin life in the real world, not knowing quite what to expect but optimistic about the future. I'm guided by a desire to change the world: by improving people's lives, by fixing something that's broken, by contributing to humanity's understanding of the natural universe.
