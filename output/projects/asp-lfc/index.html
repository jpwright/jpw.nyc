As part of my M.Eng degree at Cornell, I designed and built a prototype of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-field_camera">light field camera</a>, a device which captures information about incident rays of light like a traditional camera (their position, wavelength, aggregate intensity) but also can record their direction. This allows for some interesting capabilities (refocusing images after theyâ€™ve already been taken, passive 3D range mapping, to name a few). Unlike existing technology, which uses microlens arrays (expensive and somewhat difficult to manufacture), using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angle-sensitive_pixel">angle-sensitive pixels</a> allows light field capture using a single lens and CMOS-compatible manufacturing techniques.
</p>

<p>
Using a custom hardware design with an ATXmega128A1 microcontroller as its core, data from the rolling-shutter imager is read and processed into a format that can work with a number of unique image processing algorithms, including computational refocus and passive 3D range 
mapping. The device includes dual 80 MSPS ADCs, 64 MB of SDRAM, an FTDI USB-to-Serial converter and micro-USB connector, an SD card slot, a TFT LCD touchscreen, and an integrated charge controller for a 2000 mAh polymer lithium ion battery.
