      <p>I’ve been using the <a href="http://nmeap.sourceforge.net/">NMEAP</a> library by David Howard for parsing GPS sentences for a project with an ATmega 1280. It’s a wonderful library, but it runs into problems decoding UTC timestamps on 8-bit architectures like the 1280. I found a fix and thought I would share.</p>

<p>In the function:</p>

<p><span class="code">int nmeap_gpgga(nmeap_context_t *context,nmeap_sentence_t *sentence)</span></p>

<p>Replace:</p>

<p><span class="code">gga->time = atoi(context->token[1]);</span></p>

<p>with:</p>

<p><span class="code">sscanf(context->token[1], "%"SCNu32, &gga->time);</span></p>

<p>What’s basically happening is that the AVR implementation of <span class="code">atoi</span> will overflow UTC times past 6:55:36 on 8-bit architectures. (Since I was working on this during an all-nighter, the fact that my code stopped working at 7 AM was quite annoying.) You have to use <span class="code">sscanf</span> to specify a 32-bit result — even though <span class="code">gga->time</span> is already defined as a long, the definition of long varies based on the architecture. The best way to be sure is to look at AVRinttypes.h and use something like int32_t in your own code. Hope this helps.</p>
