## Usage

Before using Minima, make sure you've got Hugo(v0.41.0 or higher) installed on your device.

### Installation

Suppose `blog` is where you place your sources.

```bash
cd blog
git init
git submodule add --depth 1 https://github.com/mivinci/hugo-theme-minima.git themes/minima
```

Or  `clone` directly if you don't wanna use the Git submodule.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mivinci/hugo-theme-minima.git themes/minima
```

Anyways, you just need to put Minima under the `blog/themes` directory.

### Configuration

Follow [exampleSite/config.toml](https://github.com/Mivinci/hugo-theme-minima/blob/main/exampleSite/config.toml) and edit your own `blog/config.toml` file.
